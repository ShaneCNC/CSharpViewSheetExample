# CSharpViewSheetExample
This is a sample downloaded from CNC Software's mastercam.com site.
I made the changes required to run in Mastercam 2019, the project was for 2018.  It won't build,
ViewSheetSettings had an undelared named Planes, after looking at the metadata for the Class I changed it to SelectedPlanes, it built.
Why?
